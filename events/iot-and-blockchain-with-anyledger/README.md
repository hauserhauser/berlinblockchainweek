# Description for this event. This will be rendered as a <meta> tag in the HTML,
# and displayed on the /events page. Keep it short.
# Linebreaks are ignored, but they _must_ start with two spaces.
description: The IoT-blockchain space is currently very immature, because no
  scalable infrastructure exists. Companies have to build the entire
  infrastructure stack from scratch before they can build their individual use
  cases, so we would like to talk about how to change that and present a
  solution.

  In this event we will answer questions like: Which benefits will the blockchain bring to the physical world? Which problems of IoT can       be fixed using a blockchain stack? What is missing at the moment? We will also outline how AnyLedger is solving existing problems       in order to create an industry-level infrastructure layer between connected devices and blockchains.
